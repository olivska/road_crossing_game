## Description
In this single player game the goal is to happily move the turtle to the other side of the road. The turtle moves only 
forward and backwards. Using "Up" and "Down" keys player must move the reptile and watch out for cars driving on 
the road. All cars are generated randomly in different positions, although they all move with the same speed. Once the 
turtle successfully gets to the other side the player gets a point. Then the turtle is moved back to the starting position 
and the user keeps playing until turtle makes contact with any of the cars, at that moment the game is over.
